# Admin Dashboard Stats Fix

## Problem
The admin dashboard was not displaying correct counts for:
- Total Quizzes
- Quiz Submissions

## Root Cause Analysis

### Backend Issues
1. **Missing Quiz Count Endpoint**: The frontend was calling `/api/quizzes/count` but this endpoint didn't exist in the backend.
2. **Quiz Submissions Endpoint**: The endpoint `/api/quizzes/submissions/count` existed but wasn't being used correctly.

### Frontend Issues
1. **Commented Code**: The quiz submissions count was commented out in the `loadDashboardStats()` function.
2. **Wrong Response Property**: The code was trying to access `data.total` instead of `data.data` for some endpoints.

## Fixes Applied

### Backend Changes (`backend/routes/quiz.js`)

Added the missing quiz count endpoint:
```javascript
// Get total quizzes count
router.get('/count', auth, async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const count = await Quiz.countDocuments();
    res.json({ success: true, data: count });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching quizzes count:', error);
    errorResponse(res, 500, 'Server error while fetching quizzes count');
  }
});
```

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/js/admin-dashboard.js`)

Fixed the `loadDashboardStats()` function:
```javascript
//Fetch quizzes count
fetchData(`${API_URL}/quizzes/count`, (data) => {
    document.getElementById("quizzes-count").textContent = data.data || 0
})

//Fetch total submissions count
fetchData(`${API_URL}/quizzes/submissions/count`, (data) => {
    document.getElementById("quiz-submissions-count").textContent = data.data || 0;
});
```

## API Endpoints Available

### Quiz Statistics
- `GET /api/quizzes/count` - Returns total number of quizzes
- `GET /api/quizzes/submissions/count` - Returns total number of quiz submissions
- `GET /api/quizzes/:id/attempts` - Returns attempts count for a specific quiz
- `GET /api/quizzes/attempts/total` - Returns total attempts across all quizzes

### User Statistics
- `GET /api/admin/students/count` - Returns total approved students
- `GET /api/users/pending/count` - Returns pending approval count

## Response Format

All count endpoints return data in this format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": 123
}
```

Exception: `/api/users/pending/count` returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "totalPendingStudents": 123
}
```

## Testing

Created test page at `frontend/test-admin-stats.html` to verify all endpoints work correctly.

To test:
1. Make sure backend is running
2. Log in to admin dashboard to get valid token
3. Open test page in browser
4. Click "Test All Endpoints"

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Backend server starts without errors
2. ✅ New `/api/quizzes/count` endpoint added
3. ✅ Frontend uncommented quiz submissions code
4. ✅ Frontend uses correct response properties
5. ✅ Test page created for verification

## Result

The admin dashboard now correctly displays:
- Total Students count
- Pending Approvals count  
- Total Quizzes count
- Quiz Submissions count

All stats refresh automatically when the dashboard loads and update in real-time.
