# Quiz Session Management Features

## Overview
The quiz system now includes comprehensive session management that allows students to continue their quizzes from where they left off, even when switching devices or browsers.

## Key Features

### 1. Persistent Quiz Sessions
- **Automatic Session Saving**: Quiz progress is automatically saved every 10 seconds and when students navigate between questions, change answers, or flag questions
- **Cross-Device Continuity**: Students can start a quiz on one device and continue on another
- **Browser Recovery**: If the browser crashes or is accidentally closed, students can resume from their last saved state

### 2. Smart Timer Management
- **Persistent Timer**: The countdown timer continues even when the student leaves the quiz page
- **Time Tracking**: The system accurately tracks time spent away from the quiz
- **Auto-Submission**: When time expires, the quiz is automatically submitted with current answers

### 3. Session Data Stored
- Current question index
- All selected answers
- Flagged questions
- Remaining time
- Quiz start time
- Last update timestamp

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### New API Endpoint: Auto-Submit
```
POST /api/quizzes/:id/auto-submit
```
- Automatically submits quiz when time expires
- Uses saved session data for submission
- Clears session after submission
- Logs auto-submission activity

#### Enhanced Session Management
```
POST /api/quizzes/:id/session    # Save session
GET /api/quizzes/:id/session     # Load session  
DELETE /api/quizzes/:id/session  # Clear session
```

#### Session Model Updates
- Enhanced QuizSession model with all necessary fields

- `autoSubmitQuiz()`: Handles automatic submission on timeout

#### Smart Timer Features
